    <h1>A Softcover Book report</h1>
    <h2>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like some popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as novel Moby-Dick by Herman Meville (sometimes written as Moby Dick). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick">Moby-Dick</a> by Herman Meville begins with these immortal words:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        After driving off his spleens (which can't be good for you), Ishmael then goes on inmuch the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby-Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em>- is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
